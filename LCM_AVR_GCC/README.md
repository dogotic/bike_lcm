# BIKE Light Control Module

This LCM is going to be implemented using only pure C (AVR-GCC), no Arduino.
The LCM is going to communicate with front and back lights via 2.4GHz ISM band, by using NRF24L01 modules. 

## External Libraries
- an excelent NRF24L01 library I found - https://github.com/antoineleclair/avr-nrf24l01


## TO DO LIST
- [x] Test NRF24L01 Communication
- [ ] Test WS2812B LED strip
